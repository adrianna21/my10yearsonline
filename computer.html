            <p class = computer_description> my 2010s pics can all be found on my mom's facebook, i think that on its own says enuf. it was a time before i appriciated or even understood the importance of capturing my life. i was always very upset at my mom for takign so many pics, i didnt think i would hold so much love for those pictures years later. very thankful to social media and the internet for storing all these memories!  </p>
